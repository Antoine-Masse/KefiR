\title{make a biplot that allows you to see the relationship between two components of a PCA, the weight of the respective variables and to color by category

\usage{
biplt(

)
}
\arguments{
\item{pca}{a list with class "prcomp" from prcomp()}

\item{choices}{a vector indicating the indices of two desired components that we wish to relate}

\item{col}{a vector of color}

\item{threshold}{the elimination threshold to avoid displaying the variables that have the least influence on the components}

\item{xlab}{label of x}

\item{ylab}{label if y}

\item{cex}{length of points}

\item{pch}{pitch type}

\item{labels}{labels for the points}
}
\value{
a graphic biplot more esthetic of biplot() function
}

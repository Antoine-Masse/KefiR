\title{Calculate an pairwise difference between samples by bootstrap without encountering a central-limit problem}
\usage{
pairwise.boot(x, g, iter = 500, mu = "meanbp")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numerical vector}

\item{g}{categorical vector}

\item{iter}{number of iteration}

\item{mu}{comparison criterion, by default 'meanbp' (moving average per iteration: an automatic compromise between mean and median), otherwise 'mean', 'median' or 'sd'.}
}
\value{
This function returns an array of p-values like the other peerwise functions.

It calculates the number of differences between bootstrap samples that do not include 0 (all higher or all lower).

This number of differences divided by the number of iterations (iter) gives the maximum percentage of times that a convergent difference (all higher or all lower) is found: a confidence.

This value subtracted from 1 gives an equivalent of the p-value whose precision depends on the number of iterations.

Note: using the meanbp criterion is more relevant, it allows a compromise between mean and median by avoiding leverage effects.
